How to add icons to gallery
---------------------------

1. Open template.psd or any png file in your favourite editor.
2. Add/change icons in "frames".
   You can change frames sizes, but you have to follow 1:1 proportions.
3. Save file with new name.
   The name must be uniq and contain the following information:
   [newname]_[number of icons]x[frame size].png
   where:
   + newname - name of your new file
   + number of icons - number of frames with images in your new file
   + frame size - height of your new file in pixels 
   For example, "mysupercoolicons_9x75.png"
4. Choose icons for NotCaptcha that have definite upright direction.
