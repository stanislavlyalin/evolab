Simple to use profile plugin allowing front-end login, registration and edit profile by using shortcodes. 
 
== Description ==

Profile Builder is WordPress registration done right. 

It lets you customize your website by adding a front-end menu for all your users, 
giving them a more flexible way to modify their user-information or register new users (front-end registration). 
Also, grants users with administrator rights to customize basic user fields or add custom ones. 

To achieve this, just create a new page and give it an intuitive name(i.e. Edit Profile).
Now all you need to do is add the following shortcode(for the previous example): [wppb-edit-profile]. 
Publish the page and you are done!

You can use the following shortcodes:

* **[wppb-edit-profile]** - to grant users front-end access to their personal information (requires user to be logged in).
* **[wppb-login]** - to add a front-end log-in form.
* **[wppb-register]** - to add a front-end registration form.
* **[wppb-recover-password]** - to add a password recovery form.

Users with administrator rights have access to the following features:

* add a custom stylesheet/inherit values from the current theme or use one of the following built into this plugin: default, white or black.
* select whether to display or not the admin bar in the front end for a specific user-group registered to the site.
* select which information-field can users see/modify. The hidden fields values remain unmodified.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I navigated away from Profile Builder and now I can’t find it anymore; where is it? =
	
	Profile Builder can be found in the default menu of your WordPress installation under the “Users” sub-menu.

= Why do the custom WordPress fields still show up, even though I set it to be "hidden"? =

	Profile Builder only disables the default fields in the front-end of your site/blog, it does absolutely nothing in the dashboard.
